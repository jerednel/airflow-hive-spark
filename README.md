## Hive/Spark Airflow Data Pipeline

An Apache Airflow data pipeline that demos an end-to-end processing job starting from a file download, to creating a Hive table then processing the data with a Spark job.

See the Airflow DAG config [here](https://github.com/jerednel/airflow-hive-spark/blob/master/mnt/airflow/dags/forex_data_pipeline.py)
